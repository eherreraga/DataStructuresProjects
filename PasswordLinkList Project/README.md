# PasswordScanner
We are going to receive around 10 million passwords in a text file, we suppose to create a LinkList that are going to hold the passwords.
Additionally, inside the node for the LinkList their is going to be another field called "counter", this is for
if we see the same password we are going to increment the counter. Then we are going to implement the same solution, but using
a dictionary, were the key is the password and the value if the number of times this password was used. Finally, we are going 
to return the 20 most used password from both of the solutions.
